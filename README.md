# Excel_Store-analysis

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of store data for the year of 2022 to generate valuable insights and create an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The project involved gathering and cleaning data on sales, inventory, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns. I used Excel's advanced functions, pivot tables, and charts to perform detailed analyses, identify trends, and uncover key metrics such as top-selling products, peak shopping times, and customer preferences. The insights were then visualized in a dynamic dashboard, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret the data and make informed business decisions. This project not only showcased my proficiency in data analysis and Excel but also demonstrated my ability to translate complex data into actionable business strategies.
